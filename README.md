# InternetTv-IPmulticast-Stream-radio

This repository contains a InternetTV/Radio application that is implemented using multicast IP `ASM(Any Source Multicast)` model in `C` language.
This Live Streaming service can be implemented in any kind of LAN(WLAN/Ethernet) provided the server and clients are in the same network.

The project uses two different `Transport Layer Protocols(TCP/IP & UDP)` for communicating different data.And uses two
way communication for fetching radio list(TCP) and other for streaming service(UDP).

## Installation & dependencies

The Project includes many `GUI` and `VLC` plugins which will be needed for displaying the video file recieved continously.
and before u install vlc plugin make sure u have installed it with `apt` repository and not with `snap` repository.

**For VLC media Player : `sudo apt install vlc` (if installed with snap, uninstall it and install with apt).**

- Server File : `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
- Client File : It uses `Gtk2` for GUI and libvlc for integrating `vlc` window in the GUI
   - GTK3 : `sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev`
   - GTK2 : `sudo apt install libgtk2.0-dev`
   - libvlc : `sudo apt install libvlc-dev`

## Usage
**Before running the file, convert an existing audio / video file(any format) to streamable format(preferred mp4) using the command `ffmpeg -i inputfile.mp4 -f mpegts streamable_output.mp4`.**

**To Compile both use make file:**
 ```bash
make
```
**Or individually**
- Server: 

```bash
gcc iserver.c -o server -lpthread
```
- Client:

```bash
gcc -o guiclient guiclient.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0 libvlc` `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0 libvlc
```

Run:
- Server: ```./server```
- Client: ```sudo ./guiclient```
(`sudo` is mandatory as it accesses network interface for multicast IP)
